I DO NOT OFFER SUPPORT TO SET UP CORRUPT on your server. I leave up to you to set up (it's nothing complicated), simply upload the corrupt folder and allow the image folder to be written. 

I do not take any responsibility for vulnerability that your web server may occur by allowing php upload and I do not take any responsibility for any virus or malware you may get once you let people use it.

If you decide to host your own CORRUPT page, please make sure to keep the mentions and license details as they are in the html (see below):
